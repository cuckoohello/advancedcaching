This application uses your geographic position and your web service user name and password to provide a seamless geocaching experience. The geographic position is only used to show your location on a map and to guide you to geocaches.  User name and password are only used to log in at the geocaching web site and they are stored in the local configuration file for later use. On startup, the application checks whether updates are available and therefore connects to a server of the author. In the process, only connection data and the program version are transferred to the author. When the remote debugging option is activated, personal data and geographic location data may be transferred to the author of the program. Please note that the remote debugging option is for developers only and should not be activated when actual personal data is entered in the settings. Position information, user name and password are not stored or transferred in any other ways. No personal information is used for marketing or statistical purposes.
